                    <h1 id="are-you-squarely-in-the-center-of-your-passion-"><strong>ARE YOU SQUARELY IN THE CENTER OF YOUR PASSION?</strong></h1>
<p>Many people, perhaps most, don’t think of “passion” and “job” in the same sentence.</p>
<p>They believe passion is for their family, their significant other, their hobbies.</p>
<p>They lock their passion in the safe before leaving for work every day.</p>
<p>The result? Long, unfulfilling days with little to show for them.</p>
<p>Those of us who have aligned our passion with our work are excited and energized to get up in the morning, because our work is a reflection of who we are. What we were put on this earth to do.</p>
<p>I think of my passion as being a vest I wear every day.</p>
<p>Everyone can see it.</p>
<p>It’s close to my heart.</p>
<p>It keeps me warm.</p>
<p>Over the years, people have shared with me the ways in which they aligned their passion with their work. Here are three examples:</p>
<h2 id="bread-and-history"><strong>Bread and History</strong></h2>
<p>Several years ago, I met a woman who had two passions: baking and history. She had majored in history in college, been a home economist and a teacher. Partial Eclipse; not bad.</p>
<p>When I met her, she was giving baking demonstrations at the Missouri History Museum in St. Louis…educating school children on how the settlers prepared their food.</p>
<p>Total Eclipse. Perfect Alignment.</p>
<h2 id="right-place-wrong-role"><strong>Right Place, Wrong Role</strong></h2>
<p>One of my clients, a mid-level manager at a large corporation, reached out to me because she wasn’t finding her work as stimulating as she once did.</p>
<p>This sense of dissatisfaction had left her questioning everything…the company she worked for, the line of work she was in. She thought perhaps a drastic change was in order.</p>
<p>Through our sessions, she was able to bring into focus something she knew—but didn’t know how important it was.</p>
<p>Her passion is fixing broken things.</p>
<p>She has the leadership, interpersonal, business, and change management skills to take what isn’t working…what is underperforming…and make it great.</p>
<p>Once she does that, she’s ready for the next challenge. Think Mary Poppins.</p>
<p>Maintaining the status quo isn’t fulfilling to her. And that’s what she’d been doing for the better part of a year.</p>
<p>Our work together gave her the “ammunition” to have a crucial conversation with her boss, who subsequently put her in another broken department.</p>
<p>Total Eclipse.</p>
<h2 id="passion-to-educate-and-a-love-of-animals"><strong>Passion to Educate…and a Love of Animals</strong></h2>
<p>I worked with a student many years ago who was about to graduate from college. He knew two things about himself: he wanted to help the needy globally, and he loved animals.</p>
<p>He had never heard of Heifer International. When I exposed him to this global non-profit organization, it was like watching a plant take root and flourish.</p>
<p>I’m getting goose bumps just thinking about it.</p>
<p>He got a job helping people in Africa learn how to care for the livestock they received from Heifer International…livestock that would provide eggs, milk, and other life-giving food for their families.</p>
<p>Total, Utter Eclipse.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-your-career-passion">How to Find Your Career Passion</h2>
<p>With these examples in mind, here are some steps I recommend to help you find your career passion:</p>
<p>-Journaling (your perfect day, your energy around your current job tasks, dreams you had as a child and young adult, where your mind goes when you allow it to wander)</p>
<p>-Talk to close friends and family (not their advice for you, but rather their perspective about what they’ve observed about you)</p>
<p>-A career coach, like me (may include assessments and/or other activities)</p>
<p>-Conducting informational interviews</p>
<p>-Volunteering / part-time job / internship</p>
<p>If you’d like to read what I consider to be one of the best books out there on this subject, I recommend Po Bronson’s “What Should I Do with My Life?” Po interviews people who have found their “total eclipse,” as well as those who were still looking. Great read. I also recommend Tim Kelley’s book, “True Purpose.”</p>
<p>Are you in the wrong job that chips away at you every day? The CareerSpring Program will help you find a job that uses your zone of genius, recognizes your value, and pays you what you’re worth.</p>
